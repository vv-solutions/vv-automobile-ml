When the  car is shut off and has cooled, squeeze the hoses. If they  \\nare extremely stiff, make a crunch sound, are soft or sticky, have bulges, or looked collapsed in any section, it \\nmeans the hose is weak and should be replaced. You should never drive with a damaged coolant hose and your \\nengine could overheat and you coul d land up with a very expensive repair bill.  \\n \\n45. Belt Tension  \\n \\nYou should check the tension of all your belts. You should also check for wear. You’ll find belts that run your AC \\ncompressor, power steering pump, and water pump. To check for tension press in the center of the belt where the \\nlongest exposed part is found. If you can depress the belt ½” to 1” or 13mm to 25mm, but no more, the tension is \\ngood. If not you can either take your car to auto shop for adjustment or if you are handy do it yourself. W atch for \\ncracks and fraying, which mean you should replace the belt(s).  \\n \\n46.

When a timing \\nbelt fails it can result in thou sands of dollars in engine damage so it’s best to be proactive.  \\n \\n47. The Engine Clean  \\n \\nIt’s a good idea to do an engine clean every couple of years. By removing all the grime and dirt it becomes much \\neasier to see any leaks you may develop.

Loosen the lug nuts on the wheel you'll be changing using the lug wrench before raising the car with the jack. Once raised, remove the lug nuts completely and take off the flat tire. Place the spare tire onto the hub and tighten the lug nuts by hand first, then use the wrench to finish securing them. Lower the car back to the ground and tighten the lug nuts once more. Finally, replace any tools used in the trunk and ensure your spare is properly inflated for safe driving.\n"

Alternatively, it could be caused by electrical system malfunctions or even water damage. To identify the exact cause, I would recommend getting a professional diagnosis from a certified mechanic. In the meantime, try to describe the noises you're hearing in detail, such as when they occur (during acceleration, braking, or idling), their frequency, and any associated symptoms like vibrations or smells. This information can help the mechanic narrow down the potential causes and provide an accurate estimate for repairs.\n"
