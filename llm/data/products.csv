"Engine flush, 250 ml","Internal engine cleaner that removes combustion residues, soot, deposits, water and antifreeze. The engine is cleaned internally, and exhaust emissions and fuel and oil consumption are reduced.ENGINES PRODUCEWater, acids, coke, resin, salts, gases, soot, and unburned fuel are produced during one combustion. Some of these substances end up in the engine oil, which reduces the service life of the oil and causes deposits to form over time in the engine.WEAR OCCURSDeposits and impurities cause parts to wear out, hydraulic lifts to tick, piston rings to coke up, and fuel and oil consumption to increase over time.ACIDIC ENVIRONMENTWhen changing oil, new engine oil becomes contaminated by existing oil residues. This results in a shorter oil service life than if the engine was clean inside.CLEANER ENGINEEngine flush effectively cleans the internal parts of the engine from deposits that are loosened during the oil change. This gives the new engine oil a longer service life and a significantly better working environment.ADVANTAGESEffectively cleans the inside of the engine from deposits, soot, coolant, and condensation water. Reduces exhaust emissions, fuel and oil consumption by restoring the engine condition and allowing engine oil to work optimally.AREAS OF USEFor petrol, diesel and ethanol engines, as well as compressors.Also works great for motorcycles with or without wet clutch.INSTRUCTIONSAdd to a warm engineRun the engine about 20 minutes.Drain the oil.Change the filter and refill with new engine oil.DOSAGEOne 250 ml can to 4-6 litres engine oil.EUH210 Safety data sheet available on request.","SKF","Maintenance"
