Tyre mounting paste, 5 kg;Tyre mounting paste with corrosion protection for quickly and safely fitting tyres on rims. Makes fitting and removing tyres easier since the tyre does not get stuck on the rim. The paste is easy to apply to the tyre using a brush. It distributes evenly and dries quickly. Using mounting paste reduces the risk of damage to the tyres and rims when fitting/removing tyres. In addition, it reduces wear and tear on the tyre fitting machine and equipment. The product must be stored and used at room temperature.ApplicationApply thinly to the tyre inner edge using a brush or sponge. For truck and EM tyres, also apply to the rim base and the inclined axle ring. This allows the tyre to easily slide on the rim without damage. The use of tyre mounting paste ensures a technically perfect fit of the tyre to the rim, making subsequent balancing easier.EUH210 Safety data sheet available on request.;129.0;https://www.caspianpolicy.org/no-image.png;6;767;2023-05-15 15:12:27;3

Engine flush, 250 ml;Internal engine cleaner that removes combustion residues, soot, deposits, water and antifreeze. The engine is cleaned internally, and exhaust emissions and fuel and oil consumption are reduced.ENGINES PRODUCEWater, acids, coke, resin, salts, gases, soot, and unburned fuel are produced during one combustion. Some of these substances end up in the engine oil, which reduces the service life of the oil and causes deposits to form over time in the engine.WEAR OCCURSDeposits and impurities cause parts to wear out, hydraulic lifts to tick, piston rings to coke up, and fuel and oil consumption to increase over time.ACIDIC ENVIRONMENTWhen changing oil, new engine oil becomes contaminated by existing oil residues. This results in a shorter oil service life than if the engine was clean inside.CLEANER ENGINEEngine flush effectively cleans the internal parts of the engine from deposits that are loosened during the oil change. This gives the new engine oil a longer service life and a significantly better working environment.ADVANTAGESEffectively cleans the inside of the engine from deposits, soot, coolant, and condensation water. Reduces exhaust emissions, fuel and oil consumption by restoring the engine condition and allowing engine oil to work optimally.AREAS OF USEFor petrol, diesel and ethanol engines, as well as compressors.Also works great for motorcycles with or without wet clutch.INSTRUCTIONSAdd to a warm engineRun the engine about 20 minutes.Drain the oil.Change the filter and refill with new engine oil.DOSAGEOne 250 ml can to 4-6 litres engine oil.EUH210 Safety data sheet available on request.;49.9;https://productimages.biltema.com/v1/image/imagebyfilename/34-002_xl_1.jpg;10;1512;2023-05-15 15:12:27;37

Trailer adapter, 13-7;For electrical coupling on trailers with LED lights. With built-in power resistor for compatibility with cars with CANBUS light control. Connects vehicles with 13-pin connectors to 7-pin trailer connectors.The adapter is designed to fix issues that may arise in trailers with LED reverse, indicator, or brake lights.The adapter emulates the properties of a bulb, thereby eliminating any problems. Even if an LED light (which consumes little power and/or illuminates at low voltage) is installed on the trailer, it will act and be perceived by the car as an incandescent bulb.Problems that can be solved using the adapter: The LED light on the trailer shines/flashes because the car is transmitting control signals to the trailer. The car indicates erroneous functional problems on the trailer because the car does not detect the low current consumed by the LED light.NOTE! When using the adapter, the car’s control functions of the reverse, indicator, or brake lights are overridden. If any of these lights stop working, the car will still perceive them as functional.NOTE! Not suitable for vehicles with pulse-controlled power systems.;179.0;https://productimages.biltema.com/v1/image/imagebyfilename/34-998_xl_1.jpg;13;1822;2023-05-15 15:12:27;35

Trailer adapter, 13-13;For electrical coupling on trailers with LED lights. With built-in power resistor for compatibility with cars with CANBUS light control. Connects vehicles with 13-pin connectors to 13-pin trailer connectors.The adapter is designed to fix issues that may arise in trailers with LED reverse, indicator, or brake lights.The adapter emulates the properties of a bulb, thereby eliminating any problems. Even if an LED light (which consumes little power and/or illuminates at low voltage) is installed on the trailer, it will act and be perceived by the car as an incandescent bulb.Problems that can be solved using the adapter: The LED light on the trailer shines/flashes because the car is transmitting control signals to the trailer. The car indicates erroneous functional problems on the trailer because the car does not detect the low current consumed by the LED light.NOTE! When using the adapter, the car’s control functions of the reverse, indicator, or brake lights are overridden. If any of these lights stop working, the car will still perceive them as functional.NOTE! Not suitable for vehicles with pulse-controlled power systems.;269.0;https://productimages.biltema.com/v1/image/imagebyfilename/34-993_xl_1.jpg;13;1826;2023-05-15 15:12:27;4

Lambda sensor with 4 cables;Most modern engines are equipped with a lambda sensor (oxygen sensor), which is usually located in the front exhaust pipe (straight underneath the manifold) or in the catalytic converter, and measures the concentration of non-combusted oxygen in the exhaust gases. Data on the oxygen concentration is transmitted to the car’s control unit, which then calculates the correct amount of fuel to supply the engine. If the incorrect amount is supplied to the engine, this is immediately rectified by the control unit based on the information from the lambda sensor.Always make sure the fault in the exhaust purifier is due to the lambda sensor before replacing it. The new lambda sensor can be damaged by other faults in the exhaust purifier. A used lambda sensor cannot be returned for refund.Biltema’s universal lambda sensors are suitable for most cars that have original lambda sensors with four connection cables.
